    question: "Severe period pain that prevents you from going to school or work is normal and just something to endure.",
    answer: false,
    explanation: "Severe pain (dysmenorrhea) that disrupts daily activities may indicate conditions like endometriosis, PCOS, or adenomyosis. Pain that requires you to miss school/work warrants medical investigation.",
    category: "pain",
    value: "pain_normalization"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Soaking through a pad or tampon every hour is considered heavy bleeding and should be evaluated by a doctor.",
    answer: true,
    explanation: "Menorrhagia (heavy bleeding) is defined as soaking through protection hourly or bleeding lasting more than 7 days. This can lead to anemia and may indicate fibroids, hormonal imbalances, or other conditions requiring treatment.",
    category: "pain",
    value: "heavy_bleeding"
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Your energy and focus naturally fluctuate throughout your menstrual cycle, and it's okay to adjust your schedule accordingly.",
    answer: true,
    explanation: "Hormonal changes throughout your cycle affect neurotransmitters, energy levels, and cognitive function. Cycle syncingâ€”planning activities around your natural energy patternsâ€”can optimize performance and reduce burnout.",
    category: "productivity",
    value: "cycle_syncing"
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "If your doctor dismisses your period pain as 'just cramps,' you should accept their opinion and not seek a second opinion.",
    answer: false,
    explanation: "Medical gaslighting is real, especially in women's health. Endometriosis takes an average of 7-10 years to diagnose. If pain disrupts your life, you deserve thorough investigation. Seek providers who listen and validate your experience.",
    category: "advocacy",
    value: "medical_gaslighting"
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "PMS (Premenstrual Syndrome) and PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder) are the same thing.",
    answer: false,
    explanation: "PMDD is a severe form of PMS affecting 5-8% of menstruating people. It involves severe depression, anxiety, or mood swings that significantly impair daily functioning. PMDD is a clinical diagnosis requiring professional treatment.",
    category: "cycle",
    value: "pmdd_awareness"
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Irregular periods in your teens and early 20s always indicate a serious health problem.",
    answer: false,
    explanation: "While regular cycles are ideal, irregular periods are common in the first few years post-menarche as the body establishes ovulatory cycles. However, consistently irregular periods (>45 days apart or <21 days) after age 16-18 warrant evaluation for PCOS or thyroid issues.",
    category: "cycle",
    value: "irregular_cycles"
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "You should be able to perform at the same level every day of your cycle without any adjustments.",
    answer: false,
    explanation: "This expectation ignores biological reality. Estrogen and progesterone fluctuations affect everything from muscle recovery to cognitive function. Elite athletes adjust training to their cycle phasesâ€”you can too.",
    category: "productivity",
    value: "performance_expectations"
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Tracking your cycle can help you predict symptoms, plan activities, and identify patterns that may need medical attention.",
    answer: true,
    explanation: "Cycle tracking provides valuable data about your patterns, helps predict symptom timing, identifies irregularities, and creates documentation to share with healthcare providers. Knowledge is power.",
    category: "cycle",
    value: "cycle_tracking"
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Pain during sex (dyspareunia) related to your cycle is always normal and doesn't need medical evaluation.",
    answer: false,
    explanation: "While some people experience temporary sensitivity during certain cycle phases, persistent or severe pain during sex can indicate endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or other conditions. This deserves medical attention.",
    category: "pain",
    value: "dyspareunia"
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Advocating for yourself in medical settingsâ€”like asking questions, requesting tests, or seeking second opinionsâ€”is your right.",
    answer: true,
    explanation: "You are the expert on your body. Asking questions, documenting symptoms, requesting specific tests, and seeking second opinions are acts of self-advocacy, not being 'difficult.' Your healthcare is a partnership.",
    category: "advocacy",
    value: "self_advocacy"
