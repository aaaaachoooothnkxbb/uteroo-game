      recommendation: "Hey there! You're likely still getting used to your cycle, which can feel confusing at times. Hormones like estrogen and progesterone fluctuate a lot during these years, which can cause mood swings and changes in your energy levels. Be kind to yourself, and remember that what you're experiencing is normal."
    },
    {
      value: "15-25",
      label: "15-25",
      recommendation: "Hello! At your age, cycles can become more predictable, but things like stress, sleep, and even diet can influence how you feel. Hormones like estrogen and serotonin work together, so mood swings or cravings could be linked to hormonal changes."
    },
    {
      value: "25-45",
      label: "25-45",
      recommendation: "Welcome! You're in a stage where life and hormones might throw you some curveballs. Cravings, mood changes, and energy dips can all be influenced by fluctuating estrogen and progesterone levels, especially if your cycle is irregular."

      value: "1-2-weeks",
      label: "1 to 2 weeks ago",
      recommendation: "This is the follicular phase, where your body is gearing up for ovulation. Rising estrogen may make you feel more energetic, social, and even motivated!"

    {
      value: "more-than-2-weeks",
      label: "More than 2 weeks ago",

    {
      value: "less-than-21",
      label: "Less than 21 days",

    },
    {
      value: "21-35",
      label: "21 to 35 days",
      recommendation: "Your cycle length is typical, and it means your body likely follows a balanced rhythm. Hormonal fluctuations can still cause mood swings, fatigue, or cravings."
    },
    {
      value: "more-than-35",
      label: "More than 35 days",
      recommendation: "Longer cycles mean you might have more time in each hormonal phase, which can come with unique challenges. Tracking your symptoms can help you better predict what's coming."

      value: "cramps-mood-fatigue",

    {
      value: "bloating-headaches-acne",
      label: "Bloating, headaches, acne",
      recommendation: "These symptoms often happen when estrogen levels fluctuate or when your body retains water during the luteal phase."
    },
    {
      value: "nausea-back-insomnia",
      label: "Nausea, back pain, insomnia",
      recommendation: "Nausea and back pain are common PMS symptoms linked to prostaglandins, which cause uterine contractions. Insomnia can happen when progesterone drops."

    {
      value: "moody-anxious",
      label: "Moody/Anxious",
      recommendation: "Moodiness and anxiety can be linked to fluctuations in estrogen and serotonin. If this happened during your luteal phase, it's completely normal."
    },
    {
      value: "irritable-sad",
      label: "Irritable/Sad",
      recommendation: "Feeling irritable or sad could be linked to low serotonin levels, especially in the premenstrual phase. Be kind to yourself."
    }
  ],
  cravings: [
    {
      value: "salty",
      label: "Yes, salty foods",
      recommendation: "Craving salty foods can happen when your body retains water or during stress. It's okay to indulge a little, but also try potassium-rich foods."
    },
    {
      value: "sweet",
      label: "Yes, sweets or chocolate",
      recommendation: "Craving sweets is common when estrogen and serotonin dip. Dark chocolate is a great choiceâ€”it contains magnesium, which helps with mood and muscle relaxation."
    },
    {
      value: "none",
      label: "No, no cravings",
