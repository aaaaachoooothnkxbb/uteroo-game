# iOS Swift Gateway Scene – Getting Started

This guide walks you through the steps to run the SwiftUI hormone-phase gateway scene in Xcode, commit it to your own GitHub repository, and extend it into a full app. Follow the checklist in order; each step builds on the previous one.

## 1. Prerequisites
- **Hardware:** macOS device capable of running the latest Xcode.
- **Software:**
  - Xcode 15.0 or newer (from the Mac App Store or Apple Developer portal).
  - Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
  - Git (`brew install git` if not already installed).
- **Accounts:**
  - Apple ID signed into Xcode for simulator signing.
  - GitHub account with an empty repository ready (create via <https://github.com/new>).

## 2. Clone the current prototype locally
```bash
# from a terminal on macOS
cd ~/Projects  # or any workspace directory
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/uteroo-game.git
cd uteroo-game
```
If you do not yet have a GitHub repository, skip this clone and jump to step 5 to create one, then come back.

## 3. Open the SwiftUI files in Xcode
1. Launch Xcode.
2. Choose **File ▸ Open...** and point to the `ios` folder inside the cloned project.
3. Select `PhaseGatewayView.swift` to preview the SwiftUI layout.
4. Xcode will prompt you to create a preview host if needed—accept the defaults to render the landscape scene (sun, clouds, mountain range, and three phase doors).

## 4. Run the SwiftUI gateway scene
1. In the SwiftUI preview pane, click **Resume**.
2. If the canvas shows build errors, set the preview device to any iPhone (e.g., *iPhone 15 Pro*).
3. Press the **Play** button to interact with the scene. Tapping the doors (pre-menstrual, menstrual, post-menstrual) will update the spotlight card with phase-specific rituals and copy.

## 5. Create your own GitHub repository (if needed)
1. On GitHub, click **New Repository**.
2. Name it (e.g., `uteroo-ios`), set it to private or public.
3. Do not initialize with a README—leave it empty so you can push from local.

## 6. Point the local project at your repository
```bash
git remote remove origin               # remove the starter remote if present
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/uteroo-ios.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
Replace `YOUR-ORG` with your GitHub username or organization. This publishes the current SwiftUI gateway implementation to your own repository so it can be opened from anywhere, including Xcode on another Mac.

## 7. Create a proper Xcode app target
1. In Xcode, choose **File ▸ New ▸ Project...**.
2. Select **App** under iOS and click **Next**.
3. Name it `Uteroo`, set **Interface** to *SwiftUI*, **Language** to *Swift*.
4. Choose the same folder (`ios`) as the project location to keep source files together.
5. After Xcode creates the project:
   - Drag `PhaseGatewayView.swift` into the new target (ensure *Copy items if needed* is unchecked and *Add to targets* is enabled).
   - Replace `ContentView.swift` with `PhaseGatewayView()` or set `ContentView` to use the gateway view in its body.
   - Update `UterooApp.swift` (generated by Xcode) to match the existing `@main` entry point if necessary.
6. Build and run (`Cmd+R`) on the simulator. You now have a full iOS app launching directly into the hormone-phase gateway.

## 8. Commit your changes
```bash
git status
# add newly created Xcode project files
git add ios/Uteroo.xcodeproj ios/UterooApp.swift ios/Views/PhaseGatewayView.swift
# include any Assets.xcassets or Preview Content folders Xcode generated
git add ios/Uteroo/Assets.xcassets ios/Uteroo/Preview\ Content -A

git commit -m "Set up SwiftUI gateway scene Xcode project"
```

## 9. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push
```
Your GitHub repository now holds the runnable iOS project. Anyone (including you on another machine) can clone and open the Xcode project directly.

## 10. Next steps
- Flesh out navigation from each door into dedicated feature screens per hormonal phase.
- Connect the SwiftUI layer with the broader game systems (phase configs, needs, mini-games) via shared JSON or Swift models.
- Integrate assets (illustrations, sounds) and consider using Swift Package Manager for shared UI components.
- Add unit/UI tests using `XCTest` once the flows expand.

> **Note:** I cannot push to your GitHub directly from this environment. Following the steps above ensures you control the repository, history, and distribution. If you prefer collaboration, invite teammates via GitHub permissions after you push the initial commit.
